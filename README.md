this is my presentation about new technologies used instead of semiconductors and normal transistors,
history of tubes like diods and triods,
a little about other types of transistor like Quantum processing, Graphen transistors, Three dimensional chips, and Molecular, Protein, DNA types of transistors and benchmarking normal transistor and organic types.
there are some videos, gif and photos. also there are some dead codes in js and css file, that'll be cleaned soon ;)
